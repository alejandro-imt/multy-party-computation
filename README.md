# Multy-party-computation
## Description
This repository is for testing ideas about secure multi-party computation ideas for the PVS project. 

### Projects
1. Implementation to understand the operating principles of ABY3, a secure 3-party computation protocol that allows addition, multiplication by a constant, subtraction of secrets without communication between parties. Also, it allows multiplication of secrets with O(1) communication between parties and the same for dot product operations.
