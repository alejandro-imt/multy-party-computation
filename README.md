# Multy-party-computation
## Description
This repository is for testing ideas about secure multi-party computation ideas for the PVS project. 

### Projects
1. Implementation to understand the operating principles of ABY3, a secure 3-party computation protocol that allows addition, multiplication by a constant, and subtraction of secrets without communication between parties. Also, it allows the multiplication of secrets with O(1) communication between parties, and the same is true for dot product operations.
2. An implementation for testing ideas for the computation of the Manhattan distance between codes in an SMPC setting.
